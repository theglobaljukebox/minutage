It is thorned, it is sprinkled — it is compassed all around,
It is thorned, it is sprinkled, and it isn’t easy found.

But I left her with the makin’s of a young cuckoo.

The “blue” songs of Scotland are seldom “dirty” or unpleasant. They take a frank delight in sex, attaching no penalty to it. Nor do they condemn the maid when, some months later, her belly grows heavy and round. However, this song is certainly known in the Scottish parts of Northern Ireland; Robin Morton heard it from John Maguire in Co. Fermanagh, not to this tune but nevertheless to a similar jig tune in 6/8 rhythm. This is one of many songs about tavern wenches in the spirit of Robert Burns’s Merry Muses of Caledonia, in which it might well have been included. 

The great ballad singer Jeannie Robertson, a native of Aberdeen, Scotland, is featured on the Portraits series in The Alan Lomax Collection on Rounder Records.",Jeannie Robertson,Female Voice,"I come to a cross and I met a wee lass,
Says I, “My wee lassie are you willin’ to go
Take share of a gill.” She said, “Sir, I will,
For I’m the wee lassie ’at never said no.”

It’s into an alehoose we merrily did go,
And we never did rise till the cock it did crow.
And it’s glass after glass we merrily did toast,
To the bonnie wee lassie who never said no.

[This bonnie wee lassie, she being slow in drink]
The landlady opened the door and come in with a smile;
She lifted a chair with freedom and air,
“Here’s health to the lass who can jig it in style.”

[Additional verses: “O bring us some liquor,” the lassie she cried,
“To cheer up his spirits, I doubt they are low,
For it’s not what you do, bring a bottle or two,
To the bonnie wee lassie who never said no.”

The drinks she took in being the best of the gin,
Ale being myself and sober to be,
For it’s glass after glass so merry did toast,
Till the lass and the landlady found themsel’ fu’.]

“Look into my pocket,” the lassie she said,
“Here are two-and-six to pay for your bed,
And for laying me down, you owe me a crown,
Look into my pocket,” the lassie she said.

I put my hand in her pocket and five poond I took,
Says I to mysel’, I will bundle and go,
And I bade her good-bye, but she made no reply,
This bonnie wee lassie who never said no.",,Peter Kennedy; Alan Lomax,1953,Caedmon Records,"The Folksongs of Britain, Volume II: Songs of Seduction. Caedmon Records. TC-1143, 1961","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress",,,,,@Caedmon1961SongsOfSeduction

And gae bring tae me my sword.

But Ah'll brave him at his word.

O what is death but parting breath
Over mony's a bloody plain?
For in this place I've dried his face,

The reprieve wis comin oer the brig o Banff
For tae let MacPherson free.
When they put the clock a quarter before
And hanged him to the tree.

There's some come here to see me hung
And some tae buy ma fiddle.

Recorded by Alan Lomax in Newport, Rhode Island, August 1966. 
Previously unreleased.

A series of remarkable 78-rpm records made in the late 1920s that achieved legendary status among aficionados of old time music led to the “rediscovery” of Moran Lee Boggs (1898–1971) in the early 1960s. Better known as Dock Boggs, he was a coal miner all his working life and, in his early years, spent his spare time entertaining the mining communities of the southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky border where he lived. His emotional banjo playing and stark vocals made haunting music that reflected the economic circumstances of both the black and white miners whose musical traditions he encountered and absorbed. It is the melancholy engendered by listening to his music that proved his greatest appeal, a mood that is infused with the blues of his black mining neighbors. Based on the “Darling Corey” theme, “Country Blues” comes from the tradition of white blues ballads that developed alongside their black counterparts during the final years of the nineteenth century. The music of Boggs and his ilk became familiar to Alan Lomax during the late 1930s when he began studying the catalogues of commercial phonograph companies, looking for parallels to the music that he and his father were collecting in the field.

Shot through her heart, lying cold on the ground.

The smoke begin to fly, the blood begin to run.
They shot my poor sweetheart with a forty-four gun.

I saw her on Monday before that sad day.
They found her poor body and took it away.

Who had the heart, who had the face,
To murder my sweetheart in this lonesome place?

I laid out six months and prayed all the time,
They might find the one that committed the crime.

No one could go back and my character save;
The flowers had faded on poor Ellen’s grave.

So now I’m in jail and, God knows, it’s hard,
While sweetheart sleeps down in the lonesome graveyard.

Now I’m in jail, a prisoner am I,
But God is here with me and hears every vow.

I didn’t love little Ellen to make her my wife,
But I loved her too dear as to take her sweet life.

Oh, the jury will hang me, that is, if they can,
But God knows I’ll die as an innocent man.",,Alan Lomax; Shirley Collins,1959,Prestige Records,"Southern Journey Recordings, ACE Online Archive","Alan Lomax Collection, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress",,,,Ballads and Breakdowns from the Southern Mountains.

It grieves me sorely to depart
And leave them all behind

My loving wife, don't grieve for me
Neither lament nor mourn
For I shall with Jesus be
When you are left alone

The object of my love
The time's been sweet I've spent with you
You sweet and harmless dove

How often you have looked for me
And ofttimes seen me come
But now I must depart from thee

Made out of Spanish leather. 
Place your little white hand in mine, 
And here we'll part forever,

Carters sang while driving their merchandise and in the fùnnachi (warehouses) where they stopped for refreshment and challenged one another to contests of vocal virtuosity Today, the elaborately carved and decorated Sicilian carts are no longer used for work, but older drivers continue to engage in singing competitions. The basic metrical form of the Sicilian canzuna (and indeed of Italian folk poetry in general) is a one-stanza octave of alternately rhymed hendecasyllabic lines (though some have six — as here — or ten, or less often, four or twelve lines). Lyrics may be about love or disdain, the carter’s trade, or religious devotion. The melody, modal with sporadic chromaticisms (sharps and flats), is binary. The rhythmically free virtuoso performance features pronounced melismatic ornamentation. In this recording, we hear the driver singing as he guides the reins of his horse. The six-line text echoes a typical folk motif: the visit to the house of the sweetheart to give her a handkerchief as a pledge of love. The melody, with its descending outline, has the range of an octave. Cadences on V and I correspond to the words of the couplet.","Domenico Lanza, jingling reins",Male Voice; Jingling Reins,"Assira cci passavu ddi l’amuri,

Seasonal workers would organize themselves into teams and were paid by the basket. The number of salinari (salt workers) per team varied from a minimum of eight to a maximum of 16, depending on the size of the salt works. The harvest was divided into three cycles, broken by 15 days of inactivity. Work began before dawn, between two and three in the morning, and continued until four in the afternoon, with pauses for meals at 9:00 A.M. and midday. It was directed by a curatulu or mastru i salina (superintendent), who would designate a trustee to measure the number of baskets of salt gathered. 

The work was carried out under a baking sun, sometimes during the relentless blowing of the sirocco from Africa. To make it bearable, the workers sang as they carried the 40 - pound baskets. Singing raised morale and increased production, since the workers were paid by the piece. By singing out the count they could also avoid being cheated by the padrone. The count normally went from one to 24 and was based principally on untranslatable jargon expressions. Many of the terms are variations on the word sale (salt) — salalina, and salannui, for example. The song rhythms are regular and driving and the singing style tends toward shouting. The descending melodies range within a sixth and tend to be pentatonic. 

The melody is a lament pressed out of the body of the singer as the basket grows heavier and heavier on his shoulders. One of the oldest, most primitive wailing tunes of the Mediterranean, sung in a pinched and high falsetto voice, which permits the singers to ornament and decorate the melodies with shakes, growling sobs, and prolonged groans at the end of the line — very African.... At the end the labor contractor came up and took his cut from what we paid the men. — Alan Lomax, notebook, 1954","Alternating male solos: Alberto Piacentino, Salvatore Frigerio",2 Male Voices,"First song:

The last tonnara, at Pizzo, ceased operating in 1963. “U leva leva” was sung during the levata, or raising of the net, the part of the fishing immediately preceding the mattanza, or butchery, of the tuna. Driven by barriers made by the nets, the fish, after going through several intermediate “chambers,” entered the so-called camera della morte or death chamber, the only one with a net at the bottom. When their number was deemed  sufficient, their every way of exit was barred and the raising of the net began. The men lifted it from the bottom with the help of a capstan, causing the death chamber enclosure to become smaller and smaller. They then quickly harpooned the fish as they emerged from the water and heaved them onto the barge. The laborious task was accompanied by the cadence of a responsorial song, in which a chorus answers a soloist, who sets  the rhythm of the circular pace around the capstan and hence of the work. The singing here comprises two rhythmic/ melodic sections. In the first section the leader intones two distinct melodies. The second section answers to the need to sustain an ever-increasing physical effort, reflecting the growing difficulty of raising the net imprisoning the tuna. Here the leader also intones two melodies. The chorus, respecting the responsorial principle virtually throughout, answers the leader’s rhythmic/melodic model without introducing any variations of its own, the occasional overlapping between leader and chorus not counting as variations.
 
The repertoire of the 1954 Vibo Marina tonnara was reconstructed for this recording. The fishermen put out to sea and mimed the levata and part of the mattanza, turning around a capstan and weaving their work procedures into their formalized musical performance for the benefit of the two ethnomusicologists. Lomax recalled:

I remember one day when I set up the battered old Magnacord on a tuna-fishing barge, fifteen miles out on the glassy blue Mediterranean. No tuna had come into the underwater trap for months, and the fishermen had not been paid for almost a year. Yet they bawled out their capstan chanteys as if they were actually hauling in a rich catch, and a certain point slapped their bare feet on the deck, simulating exactly the dying convulsions of a dozen tuna. Then, on hearing the playback, they applauded their own performance like so many opera singers.","Rocco Cannovino, Salvatore Canduci, Onofrio Lopresti, team of fisherman",3 Male Voices,"Tiramu…

During Easter Week throughout Spain, towns and villages hold processions in which statues and images of Mary, Christ and saints, depending on the place, are carried through the streets. Traditionally, a man or a woman spontaneously bursts into a saeta, an improvised song of praise, to the image passing by; literally an “arrow”, piercing the air and the solemn, respectful silence which always surrounds it. These three saetas were sung to the Virgen de la Soledad (Virgin of Loneliness) and Christ of Nazareth.","La Macarena, military band, crowd noises","Band, Crowd Noises","Al alborear el día, sale Jesús rescatado;

The melody sung here is very similar to one used for the reapers’ songs and for this region’s hernandillas songs, sung to the rhythm of the work: one person sings the story and the other or others respond with the refrain. In other La Mancha areas, the ballad is also sung, often as part of the Christmas season repertoire. It also appears in neighboring Extremadura (Rounder 1700) and several other parts of the Luso-Hispanic world, including the Sephardic tradition. This is a fragment of the ballad, in which a lady tells a reaper to go ahead and “reap”. At midnight he sighs,“my sickles are broken, I won't be able to reap tomorrow.” She offers to replace his metal “sickles” with silver ones; the next day “a reaper has died, slain by a serrana [tough mountain woman].” —Ed.","Antonio Moreno Calatrava,
